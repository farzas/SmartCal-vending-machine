# smartcal-vending-machine

This project simulates the functionality of a smart vending machine, using object-oriented design techniques and 
design patterns in Java.

The project mainly consists of three modules: User, Administrator and Supervisor.

The vending machine offers the user a variety of products like beverages, candy and sandwiches, as well as provide nutritional 
information about them. The user can buy a desired product from the vending machine and pay for a food item using multiple 
payment options.The project also implements a central monitoring station which is managed and controlled by the administrator 
and the supervisor. The supervisor supervises the overall working of the various vending machines that are installed in 
different locations and instructs the administrator to take appropriate actions if required.

The following design patterns were used in this project:
● Factory Method
● Singleton
● Facade
● Iterator
● MVC Architecture
● Data Access Object
● Security Patterns (Strategy is used for check point)
